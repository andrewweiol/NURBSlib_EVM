#### -2-  

Add more points on the curves as shown in the pictures below (and make them red and size 5.0 as well)
* Arc curve, very close to the corner of the two curve. Set u to 1.0, so it is in the corner istelf
* Arc curve, very close tot he far left end. Set u to 0.0 so it is on the far edge
* Line curve, towards the corner, but not too close. Set u to 0.22
* Line curve, towards the right end. Set u to 0.7
