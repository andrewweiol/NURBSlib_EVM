The raw material will be PartDesign sketches, so this is a good place to put the toolbars for the time being. \r\n\r\nHere is a picture of how i like to group them:\r\n![toolbar setup](https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/site_stuff/basic_usage/setting%20up%20the%20toolbars.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
