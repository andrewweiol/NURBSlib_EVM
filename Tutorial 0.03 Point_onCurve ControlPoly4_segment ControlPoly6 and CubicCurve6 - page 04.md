### Usage - Continued
#### -4-

* Pick the first segment polygon, hit CubicCurve_4 ![CubicCurve4](https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/icons/CubicCurve4.png?raw=true)
* Set the curve color to dark orange
* repeat for second segment polygon

* select the arc curve segment on the left (away from the center). Use Part Extrude, 20 mm   

Sometimes Part Extrude creates multiple entities. Carefully deletes extras. inspect your model to make sure you lose don't an important element. Alternatively, just hide the extras, but this could be confusing later. Sometimes Part Extrude moves the underlying curve out of the main model tree, sometimes it doesn't! If you try to delete something and it complains about links, cancel!   

* set the Display mode to shaded (hides the edges)
* set the color to light orange

### -4-

Repeat steps -2- and -3- with the  line curve on the right
* create segment polygons witht e CubicCurve_4 object and the Point_onCurve objects
* create CubicCurve_4 objects form the section polygons
* extrude the outer curve segment (far right side)
* set colors and element sizes along the way. If you don't, you will likely be unable to hide/show the correct elements later on, as a result you will not be able to make the proper selections, create the correct new elements, or edit them if you somehow did.
