<p>My python scripts for creating surfaces in <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>.<br>
Extremely early release. Makes alphas look polished :)</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/site_stuff/current_state/G2%20join%2066%20surfaces%2005.png?raw=true" alt="A semi decent G2 seam between two surfaces"></p>

<p>At this time, none of the entities created by these scripts are parametric. 
This is the rough workflow prototyping phase. 
If/when the surface creation methods reach my minimum goals, i intend to make them parametric.</p>

<h3>
<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h3>

<p>There is a release, or you grab from master.</p>

<p>-from <a href="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/tree/master/NURBSlib_EVM_python">NURBSlib_EVM_python</a>, take NURBSlib_EVM.py, all *.fcmacro files<br>
-grab the <a href="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/tree/master/icons">icons</a><br>
-put them somewhere FreeCAD can find them<br>
-link the fcmacro scripts to icons, descriptions(use macro name), tooltips (use macro name), etc.<br>
-put all those GUI macros in toolbars.<br>
-add those toolbars to the PartDesign workbench. The raw material will be PartDesign sketches, so this is a good place to put the toolbars for the time being.   </p>

<p>Here is a picture of how i like to group them:

<h3>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p><strong>Draw sketches of lines/circles</strong> (check each curve macro to see what inputs it wants). </p>

<p>In the picture below we see:<br>
-a sketcher arc<br>
-a sketch of three lines connected end to end<br>
-three 'node' sketches. A node is one circle + any number of lines that start at the circle center. I have big plans for these little nodes...curvature data...derivative of curvature data...topology data!
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/site_stuff/basic_usage/_01%20sketches%20as%20inputs.png?raw=true" alt="sketches as inputs"></p>

<p>Select those lines/circles <em>in the order specified by the macro</em>, then hit the macro button. A curve is created.
In the picture below:<br>
-select the arc, then hit<br>
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/icons/icon_bitmaps/Arc_to_rational_bezier.png?raw=true" alt="Arc_to_rational_bezier"><br>
This converts a sketch arc to a <strong>cubic</strong> <strong>rational</strong> bezier curve, formulated from a full NURBS.<br>
-select the three lines from the single sketch in order, then hit<br>
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/icons/icon_bitmaps/Bezier_Cubic_3_lines.png?raw=true" alt="Bezier_Cubic_3_lines"><br>
This creates a cubic bezier curve, formulated from a full NURBS. The weights are all 1, so it's not rational <em>in practice</em>, but the weights are there, and in the future, we may modify them.<br>
-from one node, select the circle, then the line end point, then another node, select a line endpoint, then the circle. hit<br>
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/icons/icon_bitmaps/Bezier_Cubic_2_nodes.png?raw=true" alt="Bezier_Cubic_2_nodes"><br>
Same type of curve as above.   </p>

<p>Why the funky selection order with nodes? The circles represent curve endpoints, and the lines radiating from them represent the tangents. The multiple lines give hints as to the intended topology. This is a 3D bezier control, and picking a circle is WAY easier than trying to explain to FreeCAD which point i want when there are many lines connecting at a point. [TODO, maybe: adapt the macro so the selection goes: circle&gt;line&gt;cirle&gt;line, extract the line endpoints, and reorder automatically)</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/site_stuff/basic_usage/_02%20curves%20from%20sketches.png?raw=true" alt="curves from sketches"><br>
The new arc is right on top of the sketch arc, so it looks funny.</p>

<p><strong>Make surfaces from the curves</strong><br>
The surface macros need to be given 3 or 4 curves of the <em>same type</em>. This is why we had to convert the arc.<br>
There are two types of surface right now:<br>
-rational bezier (accepts 3 or 4 cubic rational bezier curves)<br>
-6 pole by 6 pole NURBS (accepts 4 NURBS curves with 6 control points and a specific knot vector)</p>

<p>First, lets stay with bezier (icons are mostly red)</p>

<p>Select 3/4 curves in a loop counterclockwise (surface normal will then point towards you), hit<br>
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/icons/icon_bitmaps/Bezier_cubic_4_sided_surface.png?raw=true" alt="Bezier_cubic_4_sided_surface"><br>
This creates a rational bezier surface.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM/blob/master/site_stuff/basic_usage/_04%20surfaces%20from%20curves.png?raw=true" alt="bezier surfaces from bezier curves"><br>
Note that the arc edge is still a <em>true arc</em>, so we should be able to make good FreeCAD shells that join this surface type to other FreeCAD surfaces.</p>
