## NURBSlib_EVM
My python scripts for creating surfaces in [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/).   

At this time, none of the entities created by these scripts are parametric. 
This is the rough workflow prototyping phase. 
If/when the surface creation methods reach my minimum goals, i intend to make them parametric.
