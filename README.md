# FreeCAD_Scripts_EVM
My python scripts for FreeCAD

there is a lot of stuff here right now:   
-a single .py with all the 'geometry' functions, where i try to use the most basic inputs.   
-individual .fcmacro files that tie the current GUI and selection behavior of FreeCAD to single modeling operations.   
-test model files. Here it gets incredibly messy because i use both git and horrible filenames to track different versions.   

the basic flow for the scripts is:  
-write a function in BezCubic.py   
-write a GUI wrapper   
-make a toolbar button   

i don't have any premade toolbars or icons yet.

I'm aware of the plugin loader tool that's available, and i wish i was smart enough to use it, b ut i'm not :)
