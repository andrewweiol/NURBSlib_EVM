##ControlPoly4 and CubicCurve4 macros in NURBSlib_EVM

[return to main page](http://edwardvmills.github.io/NURBSlib_EVM/)

This 'tutorial' is meant to give a glimpse of the NURBSlib_EVM _library

### Requirements to follow this presentation:
* ability to set up a macro in [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/)
* ability to create sketches of lines and arcs in FreeCAD
* an understanding of the three basic planes in FreeCAD

### Specific investment of time required:
* download three files from this repositiory
* set up two FreeCAD macros
* 5 minutes to read this pages


### Let us begin:
from [master](https://github.com/edwardvmills/NURBSlib_EVM) /NURBSlib_EVM_python, copy:
* NURBSlib_EVM.py
* ControlPoly4.FCMacro
* CubicCurve4.FCMacro

Place them in your FreCAD macro folder

In FreeCAD. set up macros for ControlPoly4 and CubicCurve4.

right now the icon names do not match the macro names. Ignore the icons folder. Sorry. Only two macros are used in this presentation so i think we'll survive.

* Draw a sketch with 3 lines connected end to end. 3 lines. Exactly. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three
